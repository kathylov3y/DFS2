<div class="column"> The narrator, by contrast, tends to be all swooning sensitivity, imagining people in their homes “reading, sleeping, fucking, crying, watching television” as she drives by night across Arkansas. Her empathy doesn’t always survive actual human contact; in Oklahoma, she observes a mother “with a face and arms the texture of boiled chicken” feed her toddler “long fries dripped first in ketchup, then in mayonnaise” while talking about “price discounts in the local supermarket”, the child replying with “inhuman burbles and shrieks”.

When the narrator learns of a looming deportation flight, it injects longed-for impetus, but the race to intercept the plane ends only with her lashing out at a wire fence separating her from the airfield. There’s pathos here, but maybe not quite how Luiselli intends; it gets hard not to crave a bit of the chutzpah on show in a more conventional social problem novel such as Rachel Kushner’s recent The Mars Room, which simply rolls up its sleeves to brazen out the difficulty of imagining its way into prison life.

Luiselli’s more cautious approach – her narrator muses on whether she “can or should make art with someone else’s suffering” and talks us through the underlinings in her copy of Susan Sontag’s journals – may be more honest but its insights are moot, especially when the noodling ends up having to go toe to toe with the bald facts of “migrant mortality reports” inserted into the narrative, describing children found dead from exposure in the desert. When the narrator agonises over “the best way to tell the story”, you can’t help but feel Luiselli already figured it out in Tell Me How It Ends, a nonfiction book based on her experience interpreting for child migrants held by the US.

In the end, Lost Children Archive runs out of steam and has to change tack, switching perspective to the narrator’s stepson as he plans to run away, as if becoming a lost child himself might make him more interesting to his mother.

The episode might have fuelled the novel all by itself, but in selling this very different story in the shape of another, Luiselli, almost despite herself, seems to fall into the trap of thinking the personal isn’t political enough.</div>
